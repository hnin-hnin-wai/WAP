1.	How many callbacks queues in Node.js and what are they? Give examples to explain how different callbacks are enqueued in different queues.

When a stack is empty, the following call backs are executed  in  event loop.

(1)Timer – It works after process.nextTick and promises(Micro tasks) queue are done. 
Example-setTimeOut() function 
(2)I/O callback- Example -read file
(3)Polling- Example - check a read file function that is completed or not. If it is done, it will back to I/O call back.
(4)Check-  it execute after timer, I/O call back and polling 
Example – setIntermediate() function
(5)Close- it execute after all other queue call backs.
